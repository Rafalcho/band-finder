## Overview

Band Finder enables you to find your favourite artists, browse and preview their top tracks, albums as well as check out similar artists and filter artists by genre. I used Spotify API for the data.

In the meantime Sporify has changed their API endpoints and now every query needs to be authorized so you have to login into your Spotify account if you want to use this app.
